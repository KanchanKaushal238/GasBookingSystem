	    The objective of this project is to create the system where the customer can easily book their LPG gas cylinder through online system
	    and agency can track the record of its customer and the delivery of the cylinder.The system will help the customers by providing a 
		simple user interactive interface for booking the gas through online which will save their time and money. It also gives the agencies 
	    ease by helping them make the booking process faster and easier to maintain.There are various steps to book a gas like issuing an 
		entry book, to travel agency from that to go to the delivery centre, our system makes this whole process at one place. Basically, 
		there are two types of users for the cylinders domestic and other is commercial.It gives every user a simple and secure system by 
		authorizing the user before entering the system.
		This is helpful to the agency to get all the desired data through so many simple steps without going 
	    through manual records.The system will display the user the number of the gas they booked through online with detail description as 
	    there should be limited time after which new gas can be booked.
	    To ensure a simple and secure environment for the consumer and the agencies we are making the ‘Online Gas Booking System’. 
	    Through this system, we are solving the customers’ problems in a lot of way like to book their gas cylinder from home 
	    without travelling to the agency and stand in a queue to just book the gas.On the other hand, it also makes easier for
	    the agency to check the number as a person has booked in a specific amount of time and the person who is booking the gas 
	    is authenticated or not whether he/she has brought the bottle within the time period, to get his gas booked.It also prevents
	    any error while registering the gas as if it’s done manually there is always a chance of omission and oversight. It also 
	    helps the agency to move from a manual system of registering the data to storing it online which digitized the agency and 
	    reduces their overall carbon footprint.It will avoid the agency from spending a huge amount of their budget in maintaining the 
	    manual records and updating them from time to time.As the customer moves from another city its records can be easily
	    transferred or deleted from the record.All the operation will become easier as all information that is provided from the
	    system is very reliable and high amount data space is used.It also influences the user registration for the booking and the
	    transaction process as it has the simple interface for booking the system through which customer can easily book the gas 
	    cylinder after that a payment process is also secured.The determination of system is to provide the user with a simple and 
	    secure software which is understandable, easier to store and search the information.
